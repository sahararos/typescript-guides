// Lesson 12 - Strings
// Strings = text data
// string of letters or characters.
// You can use '', "" or `` to create strings.
var book = "The Magicians Nephew"; // double quotes.
var author = 'C.S. Lewis'; // single quotes.
var series = "The Chronicles of Narnia"; //backticks
// We do we have 3 different ways to write strings?
//The single and double quotes are basically the same. 
/* However, the more modern way of writing strings with backticks
provides some extra functionality. More on that in later lessons. */
