// Lesson 12 - Strings

// Strings = text data
// string of letters or characters.
// You can use '', "" or `` to create strings.

let book = "The Magicians Nephew"; // double quotes.
let author = 'C.S. Lewis'; // single quotes.
let series = `The Chronicles of Narnia`; //backticks

// We do we have 3 different ways to write strings?
//The single and double quotes are basically the same. 
/* However, the more modern way of writing strings with backticks
provides some extra functionality. More on that in later lessons. */

let dialogue = "John asked: 'What is the time?'";
let newDialogue = 'John said: "Please don\'t do that"'; // You can use \ (option+รถ on keyboard) 
// to say that the ' is part of the string.


let tip = "We can escape quotes by using \\";
console.log(tip);
